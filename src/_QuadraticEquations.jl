# This function finds the real roots of the quadratic equation,
# a x^2 + b x + c = 0  The number of real roots (either zero, one or two) is
# returned, and their locations are stored in x0 and x1.  If no real roots are
# found then x0 and x1 are not modified.  If one real root is found (i.e. if
# a=0) then it is stored in x0.  When two real roots are found they are stored
# in x0 and x1 in ascending order.  The case of coincident roots is not
# considered special.  For example (x-1)^2=0 will have two roots, which happen
# to have exactly equal values.          The number of roots found depends on
# the sign of the discriminant b^2 - 4 a c.  This will be subject to rounding
# and cancellation errors when computed in double precision, and will also be
# subject to errors if the coefficients of the polynomial are inexact.  These
# errors may cause a discrete change in the number of roots.  However, for
# polynomials with small integer coefficients the discriminant can always be
# computed exactly.
# 
#   Returns: Cint

# two) and the locations of the roots are stored in z0 and z1.  The roots are
# returned in ascending order, sorted first by their real components and then
# by their imaginary components.  If only one real root is found (i.e. if a=0)
